cookie clicker game for stocks

Your mom gives you $1000 when you start your firset job at 16. 
	You get money at your job by clicking as fast as you can 
As you play, you get options
	1. go to a party - 100
	2. spend time taking a cert to get a new job +25 per click

once you get 18
	You can buy a car to get a new job that makes more money
	or
	you can go to college and increase expenses with small income, but eventually get to large increase in income
		less time to click, and less money per click
	
once you get to 21: you can now buy alcohol and gamble
	Las vegas trip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		You can gamble hella money and drink hella
		or
		Finish degree and get higher paying job


You get to 30: You realize your age starts with a 3
 


Loss condition: 
	go below 0
	stupid enough decision that you die

	
	if time allows: 
	we add loan concept	
	Happiness counter: if it goes too low, depression and die
	Loss of motivation so you get less and less productive at your job. 

Logistics that we need to figure out:
UI for bitlife
Time Variable and Money Variable
	Time Variable
		How long users have to get money
		Every x seconds, new option popup
		no global time pause: it will always move on just like life
	
	Money Variable
		Click Counter
		Amount per click
			time for clicking are based on jobs and age

		
Every time we get an option that can include budgeting: you will get a small script on hwo you can do this in real life 
	ie if you choose to save 20 bucks a week instead of eating out, you will get budgeting suggestions (FROM GPT) that you can use IRL
